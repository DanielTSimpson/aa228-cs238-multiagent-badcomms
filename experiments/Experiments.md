There are 4 experiments to run for the 2-drone no comms system:
    One Drone                       Experiment 7    Done
    Two Drones (No Comms)           Experiment 8    Done
    Two Drones (Comms Cost = 0)     Experiment 9    Done
    Two Drones (Comms Cost = 1)     Experiment 10   Done
    Two Drones (Comms Cost = 2)     Experiment 11   Done
    Two Drones (Comms Cost = 10)    Experiment 12   Done
    Two Drones (Comms Cost = 100)   Experiment 13   Done


For each experiment, there are 4 parameters to track:
    Total Time (s)
    Average # of Comms (Qty)
    Average Total Cost
    Failure Rate (%)

Drone 1 is Blue (One Drone)
Drone 2 is Green
Fire is Red
